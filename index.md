## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs


Lab 6:  Part 2

I liked the lab 6 blackjack because I played blackjack and poker with my 
family for years. It helped me to learn how to better use operators. 
Also, it helped me learn if, else, and else if statements. 
Once I figured out these details I went well from there on out.


Lab 7: Part 1

At the time this lab was one of the most difficult labs for me 
(at the time). I ran into multiple issues with the Authors file, 
and the Unittest did not recognize some of my code. Which made 
for a good(?) learning experience. Now I know what issues to look 
for in my other assignments.


Labs 10 (Part 2) & 11 (Part 2)

Labs 10 and 11 (part 2) were different games; a secret number 
game and the Hi-Lo game. I have always been interested in 
Video games and their developers. While what I worked on was far 
from complex especially when compared to what I have played. I still 
thought it was interesting to see the code work. I learned how to use 
conversion tools like static cast.
